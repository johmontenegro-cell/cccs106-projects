## Programs Created

### 1. hello_world.py
- **Status:** ✅ Completed
- **Features:** Student info display, age calculation, system info
- **Notes:** I have observed that running or executing a program via cmd requires precise file location management. This help us and every other programmers to stay focused and be aware when we try to access our files. Not doing so would lead to various of problems.

### 2. basic_calculator.py
- **Status:** ✅ Completed
- **Features:** Basic arithmetic, error handling, min/max calculation
- **Notes:** I have observed that both of the programs worked without errors in the activated virtual environment. Even after modifying the code it still worked.

## Challenges and Solutions

In my 3rd year of exploring the tech industry, I have yet to explore the magic of using cmd and making a virtual environment which is really alarming as I should be honing these skills by now. I had a basic knowledge about file handling since it was taught on our freshman years, so I had no problem understanding how to access the files and managing file paths. The only issue I encountered is setting up the environment. There were unneccesary packages installed, which required me to restart setting up the environment. Without the guide that Sir Ibo has provided, I doubt I'd be able to finish this activity. In the end, it all went smoothly. The files were accessed and executed properly without errors. 

## Learning Outcomes

This activity became a refresher for my python programming skills since I've been rusty with it for months now. The most remarkable learnings I have consumed in this activity is setting up a virtual environment. Understanding this helped me appreciate the importance of keeping my coding workspace clean and partitioned for different kinds of work for different courses. This inspired me to clean up my unfiltered files and make their own dedicated workspace for a less confusing file navigation whenever I work on my projects.
