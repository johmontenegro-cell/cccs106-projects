## Challenges and Solutions

I encountered errors when I tried to git add my week3_labs to my github account. I checked the directory and it wasn't there. Turns out the week3_labs folder was outside the cccs106-projects folder. I placed it inside as a solution and ran "dir" on the terminal to check, and to my relief it was finally there. I finally pushed it to my main branch but there were unwanted files that I needed to remove, so here I am fixing it right now.

## Learning Outcomes

I learned that we should double check our directories to see if we can access our work. Also Flet is fun and a beginner friendly for people who wants to study designing UI/UX and as a Full Stack Developer.

## Future Enhancements

I think I can do an advanced User Login after understanding the fundamentals of Flet and mysql.connector.
